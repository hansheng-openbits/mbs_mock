Deal State Management
=====================

This module provides mutable state classes that track the current status
of an RMBS deal during simulation. The state is updated each period as
cashflows are collected, allocated through the waterfall, and paid to bonds.

Key Classes
-----------
- :class:`DealState`: Main state container tracking all deal components.
- :class:`BondState`: Individual tranche balance and shortfall tracking.
- :class:`TriggerState`: Trigger status with cure logic to prevent flickering.
- :class:`Snapshot`: Point-in-time state record for reporting.

The state is initialized from a :class:`DealDefinition` and then mutated
by the :class:`WaterfallRunner` as it processes each period.

Example
-------
>>> from rmbs_platform.engine.loader import DealLoader
>>> from rmbs_platform.engine.state import DealState
>>> loader = DealLoader()
>>> deal_def = loader.load_from_json(deal_json)
>>> state = DealState(deal_def)
>>> print(f"Initial Class A balance: ${state.bonds['A'].current_balance:,.0f}")

See Also
--------
loader.DealDefinition : Immutable deal structure loaded from JSON.
waterfall.WaterfallRunner : Mutates state during waterfall execution.
reporting.ReportGenerator : Creates reports from state snapshots.

    Track an individual bond tranche's balances and shortfalls.

    This class maintains the current state of a single tranche including
    its outstanding balance, deferred amounts, and interest shortfalls.
    It is updated by the waterfall engine as payments are made.

    Attributes
    ----------
    original_balance : float
        Par value at deal closing. Used to calculate factor.
    current_balance : float
        Outstanding principal balance. Reduced by principal payments.
    deferred_balance : float
        Principal that has been deferred (for PIK bonds).
    interest_shortfall : float
        Cumulative unpaid interest that may be owed in future periods.

        float
            Factor between 0.0 (fully paid) and 1.0+ (with deferrals).

@dataclass
class TriggerState:
    """
    Track trigger status with cure logic to prevent flickering.
    
    Real RMBS deals require triggers to remain breached/cured for
    multiple consecutive periods before changing state. This prevents
    "flickering" where a trigger alternates between breached and cured
    due to minor fluctuations in the underlying metrics.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    trigger_id : str
        Identifier of the trigger being tracked.
    is_breached : bool
        Current breach status. True if trigger is breached.
    months_breached : int
        Consecutive periods the trigger has been breached.
    months_cured : int
        Consecutive periods the trigger has passed while in breached state.
    cure_threshold : int
        Number of consecutive passing periods required to cure a breach.
        Typical value: 3 periods.

        - If cure counter reaches threshold: Trigger is cured, breach counter resets.

        Once breached, a trigger requires `cure_threshold` consecutive
        passing periods to cure. This prevents oscillation between states.
