Waterfall Execution Engine
==========================

This module provides the waterfall execution logic that allocates collateral
cashflows to bond tranches according to deal rules. The waterfall is the
heart of RMBS deal mechanics, determining how interest and principal are
distributed.

Industry Gap Fixed: Iterative Solver for Circular Dependencies
-------------------------------------------------------------
Real RMBS deals have circular dependencies that a simple top-to-bottom
waterfall cannot handle:

- **Net WAC Cap**: Bond coupon cannot exceed available interest.
  - Formula: Available Interest = Collections - Fees
  - Problem: Some fees are calculated based on Bond Balance.
  - Circularity: Bond Balance → Principal Payment → Interest Payment
    → Net WAC Cap → Fees → Bond Balance

- **Fee Circularity**: Trustee fees based on bond balance, but bond
  balance depends on principal payment, which depends on available
  funds after fees.

The :class:`WaterfallRunner` now includes an **iterative solver** that:
1. Runs the waterfall multiple times until values converge.
2. Handles Net WAC cap calculations.
3. Resolves fee circular dependencies.

Configuration
-------------
- ``max_iterations``: Maximum solver iterations (default: 10)
- ``convergence_tolerance``: Balance difference threshold (default: $0.01)

Example
-------
>>> from rmbs_platform.engine.waterfall import WaterfallRunner
>>> from rmbs_platform.engine.compute import ExpressionEngine
>>> engine = ExpressionEngine()
>>> runner = WaterfallRunner(engine, max_iterations=15, convergence_tol=0.001)
>>> state.deposit_funds("IAF", 50000)
>>> state.deposit_funds("PAF", 100000)
>>> runner.run_period(state)  # Automatically uses iterative solver if needed
>>> print(f"Class A balance: ${state.bonds['A'].current_balance:,.0f}")

        **Iterative Solver**: If ``use_iterative_solver=True`` or the deal

        Execute one waterfall (interest or principal) for the period.

        The waterfall processes steps sequentially, checking conditions
        and making payments from source funds to targets (bonds, fees,
        or other funds).

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : DealState
            Current deal state.
        waterfall_type : str
            Which waterfall to execute: "interest" or "principal".

        Notes
        -----
        **Step Processing**:

        1. Check condition (skip if False).
        2. Determine available funds in source bucket.
        3. Calculate target payment amount.
        4. Pay the minimum of available and target.
        5. Record any shortfall in the specified ledger.

        **Actions**:
        - ``PAY_BOND_INTEREST``: Pay interest to a bond group.
        - ``PAY_BOND_PRINCIPAL``: Pay principal to a bond group.
        - ``TRANSFER_FUND``: Move cash between funds.
        - ``PAY_FEE``: Pay a fee (cash leaves the structure).
